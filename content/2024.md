The 2024 Open Source Cryptography Workshop will take place after [RWC 2024](https://rwc.iacr.org/2024/) in Toronto, Canada.

You can see information about our [2023 workshop](/2023).

## Contributed Sessions
The Open Source Cryptography Workshop is returning for 2024, again after [RWC](https://rwc.iacr.org). Weâ€™re requesting ideas for sessions from the community, focused on those who build and use open source cryptography libraries and solutions. Last year we held sessions about bugfinding, adopting Rustls in libcurl, and clean-sheet cryptosystem design.

Please submit [a proposal via this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdEM03uFOmFZXkBcfEQNYTcsEGhUacig0xxrzUDuWx5bEYk6Q/viewform?usp=sf_link). The organizers will be in touch within 2 weeks of your submission, and we'll let you know if we'd like more information then. 

Submissions are due **15 December 2023**.
